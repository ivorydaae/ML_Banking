### Project Sumamary
Use customer data in banking to maximize revenue from marketing campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to choose 100 clients of the bank to sell them one of the three offers in bank (Mutual Funds, Credit Card, Consumer Loan) to maximize the predicted revenue for the bank by using machine learning approaches.
### Data
For the analysis, I use the data “DMML_Project_Dataset.xlsx”.
The excel file contains several tables (on 4 excel sheets):
§ Social-demographical data (client ID, age, gender, tenure in a bank)
§ Products and actual balance (current account, saving account, mutual funds, overdraft,
credit card, consumer loan)
§ Inflow/outflow on C/A, aggregated card turnover (monthly average over past 3
months)
§ Clients actual sales and revenues. Data is available for 60 % of the clients.
### Conditions:
The bank has capacity to contact around 100 clients with a marketing offer and each client can be targeted only once (you can't retarget).
### Expected result:
§ Which clients are to be targeted with which offer?
§ What would be the expected revenue based on your strategy?
